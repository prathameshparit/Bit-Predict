# Bit-Predict

*Title:* "Bit-Predict: A Bitcoin Price Prediction Tool"

## Description:

* Bit-Predict is a tool for predicting the future price of Bitcoin using machine learning techniques. The tool is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. The tool takes a dataset of historical Bitcoin price data as input and trains a predictive model on the data. The model is then used to make predictions about the future price of Bitcoin based on different scenarios and assumptions. The tool includes a user interface that allows users to input their own scenarios and assumptions, and to view the predicted price and its uncertainty. The tool also includes a set of scripts that can be used to extract, clean, and transform the data from various sources such as Coinbase, CoinMarketCap, etc.

## Features:

* Python scripts for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
* Data sources: Coinbase API, CoinMarketCap API, historical data files
* Data fields: date, price, volume, market cap, etc.
* Machine learning algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, etc.
* Evaluation metrics: mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, etc.
* Visualization techniques: matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
* User interface: command line interface, web interface, etc.

## Usage:

To use this tool, you will need the following prerequisites:

* A Coinbase API key (optional)
* A CoinMarketCap API key (optional)
* A Python 3.x installation with the following packages: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, etc.

## Instructions:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub
2. Follow the instructions in the README file to set up your API keys and dependencies
3. Run the data extraction and transformation scripts to download and prepare the data
4. Train the model on the data using the train.py script
5. Use the predict.py script to make predictions about the future price of Bitcoin
6. Use the user interface to input your own scenarios and assumptions, and to view the predictions
